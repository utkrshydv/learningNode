# 📚 Node.js REST API Projects

This repository contains a series of RESTful APIs built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB (Mongoose)**.  
Each project demonstrates practical backend development concepts including routing, dynamic parameters, JSON operations, and deployment.

## 🏨 Project 1 → Hotels API

A REST API for managing hotel staff and menu items.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (Mongoose)

### 💡 What I Learned
- Structuring REST APIs using Express.js.

### 📚 API Endpoints

#### 👥 `/person`
- `POST /person` — Add a new staff member.
- `GET /person` — Retrieve all staff members.
- `GET /person/:workType` — Retrieve staff by role (`chef`, `waiter`, `manager`).
